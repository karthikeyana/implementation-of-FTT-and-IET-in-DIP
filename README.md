Digital image processing is an area which is cover variety of application domains in the real world scenarios. So I am going to implement the concepts of Fourier Transformation technique such One-Dimensional Fourier Transform, Two-Dimensional Fourier Transform and Image Enhancement technique such as Image Inverse, Power Law Transformation and Log Transformation. The output of my Case study is shows how the Fourier Transform and Image Enhancement Techniques are working based on user input image and understand the concepts. In feature we enhance the Applications based on concepts of DIP and their applications.
